# PRE-ENTRY VALIDATION CHECKLIST
# I MUST verify ALL these before suggesting ANY stock

## MANDATORY CHECKS (Must pass ALL)

### 1. RSI Check
- [ ] RSI between 45-60 (ideal)
- [ ] RSI NOT >65 (overbought - hard reject)
- [ ] RSI NOT <30 (oversold - wait for bounce)

### 2. Price Movement Check (3-TIER SYSTEM)
🟢 **GREEN (<2% intraday):**
- [ ] Safe to enter - proceed with other checks

🟡 **YELLOW (2-4% intraday):**
- [ ] Evaluate carefully - ALL must pass:
  - RSI <60 (not getting overbought)
  - Volume <8x (not exhaustion)
  - Time <10:00 AM (early enough)
  - Strong sector momentum (not fading)
  - If ANY concern → WAIT for pullback

🔴 **RED (>4% intraday):**
- [ ] Too late - REJECT, wait for pullback tomorrow

**Additional checks:**
- [ ] NOT up >5% in last 2 days combined
- [ ] NOT at/near 52-week high without consolidation

### 3. Volume Check
- [ ] Volume ratio 1.5x to 8x average (healthy)
- [ ] Volume NOT >20x average (exhaustion signal - REJECT)
- [ ] Volume NOT <0.5x average (no interest)

### 4. Timing Check
- [ ] Current time 9:15-10:30 AM IST (ideal entry window)
- [ ] If time >11:00 AM → REJECT entry, wait for tomorrow
- [ ] Not Friday afternoon (weekend risk)

### 5. Sector Check
- [ ] Sector showing strength (top 3 gainers)
- [ ] Sector NOT already up multiple days (rotation risk)
- [ ] NOT entering multiple positions in same sector

### 6. Technical Setup
- [ ] MACD bullish or neutral (not bearish crossover)
- [ ] Price above key support levels
- [ ] Clear stop loss level identified (4-5% for metals, 3-4% others)

### 7. Risk Management
- [ ] Position size ≤25% of available capital
- [ ] Stop loss clearly defined BEFORE entry
- [ ] Risk-reward ratio ≥1:2
