# PRE-ENTRY VALIDATION CHECKLIST
# I MUST verify ALL these before suggesting ANY stock

## MANDATORY CHECKS (Must pass ALL)

### 1. RSI Check
- [ ] RSI between 45-60 (ideal)
- [ ] RSI NOT >65 (overbought - hard reject)
- [ ] RSI NOT <30 (oversold - wait for bounce)

### 2. Price Movement Check  
- [ ] Stock NOT up >2% intraday (if yes = chasing, reject)
- [ ] Stock NOT up >3% in last 2 days (momentum exhausted)
- [ ] NOT at/near 52-week high without consolidation

### 3. Volume Check
- [ ] Volume ratio 1.5x to 8x average (healthy)
- [ ] Volume NOT >20x average (exhaustion signal - REJECT)
- [ ] Volume NOT <0.5x average (no interest)

### 4. Timing Check
- [ ] Current time 9:15-10:30 AM IST (ideal entry window)
- [ ] If time >11:00 AM → REJECT entry, wait for tomorrow
- [ ] Not Friday afternoon (weekend risk)

### 5. Sector Check
- [ ] Sector showing strength (top 3 gainers)
- [ ] Sector NOT already up multiple days (rotation risk)
- [ ] NOT entering multiple positions in same sector

### 6. Technical Setup
